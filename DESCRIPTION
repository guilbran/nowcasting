Description: Methods and tools for 'forecast' the current state (nowcast) of Brazilian economic time series. It allows: extract information in real time, creating a real time data base; estimate relationship between macroeconomic variables via dynamic factors; forecast time series in previous periods of reference; forecast time series in the current period of reference (nowcasting); recreate a data base simulating the information available in the past for evaluating forecasting models accuracy (pseudo real-time data base).
